# "Good Girl" to Grounded Woman: Breaking the People-Pleasing Cycle in South Asian Culture

**Subtitle:** Why South Asian women are conditioned to put everyone first — and how to reclaim your right to say no

She picks up on the second ring. Her mother is calling from Delhi, and the conversation follows the same familiar script. "Beta, your aunt is asking why you didn't come for Diwali. She's hurt. You know how she is." And just like that, the guilt arrives — heavy, practiced, almost automatic.

She hangs up and spends the next hour composing the perfect apologetic message to an aunt she barely speaks to. Not because she wants to, but because somewhere deep inside, a voice tells her that a good daughter would.

If this feels familiar, you are not alone. And more importantly, you are not broken.

## The Cultural Blueprint: How "Good Girls" Are Made

In most South Asian families, girls are raised with a specific instruction set. Be respectful. Be modest. Put the family first. Don't be too loud. Don't cause trouble. Adjust.

Research confirms what many women already feel in their bones. A study published in the [*Journal of Adolescent Research*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11073702/) found that South Asian immigrant families maintain stricter socialization rules for daughters than sons — with girls held responsible for preserving traditional values, religious practices, and family honour.

This is not a small cultural preference. It is a comprehensive system. A 2024 study in [*Sage Journals*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10778012231156155) documented that South Asian families continue to raise girls to be "respectful, modest, self-sacrificing, and obedient," with their worth explicitly tied to how well they serve others.

The instruction reaches its peak at marriage. The phrase **"adjust karo"** — just adjust — is often delivered on or before the wedding day itself. A study published in the [*Indian Journal of Psychiatry*](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2918313/) found that married women in India report greater psychological distress than married men, driven partly by this one-directional expectation of adaptation.

## The Price You Pay: When Pleasing Becomes Suffering

People-pleasing is not just a personality quirk. It is a pattern with measurable consequences.

A [2024 YouGov survey](https://today.yougov.com/society/articles/50734-half-of-self-described-people-pleasers-think-being-this-way-makes-life-harder) of over 1,100 Americans found that **52% of women** identify as people-pleasers, compared to 44% of men. Among women, **46% feel responsible for other people's feelings**, and 43% struggle to set boundaries.

For South Asian women specifically, the numbers are starker. Research published in [*PMC*](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3955879/) shows South Asian American women have **2.71 times higher odds** of developing an anxiety disorder compared to South Asian American men.

**Aaron Beck**, the founder of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, gave people-pleasing a clinical name: **sociotropy** — the excessive need for social approval and connection. His research identified it as one of two primary pathways to clinical depression.

## The Belief Behind the Behaviour: An REBT Lens

In my practice, I often use **Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy (REBT)** — a framework developed by Albert Ellis that targets the irrational beliefs driving emotional distress. And when it comes to people-pleasing, one belief sits at the centre of everything:

**"I must be approved of by virtually every significant person in my life, or else I am not good enough."**

REBT calls this the "must." Not "I would prefer people to approve of me" (which is healthy), but "I **must** have their approval, and if I don't, something is terribly wrong with me." The difference between preference and demand is the entire distance between wellbeing and suffering.

## From "Good Girl" to Grounded Woman: Practical Steps

Breaking the people-pleasing cycle does not mean becoming cold, unfeeling, or abandoning your culture. It means learning to distinguish between generosity that comes from choice and compliance that comes from fear.

**1. Name the belief, then question it.**
When you feel the pull to say yes against your will, pause. Ask yourself: what belief is driving this? Then apply the REBT test: *Is this belief true? Is it helpful? What would I tell a friend who believed this?*

**2. Start with low-stakes boundaries.**
You do not need to confront your mother-in-law on day one. Start small. Decline a social obligation that drains you. Let a phone call go to voicemail. Notice that the world does not end.

**3. Separate guilt from harm.**
Guilt is a feeling, not evidence. Feeling guilty about saying no does not mean you have actually hurt someone.

**4. Redefine selflessness.**
True selflessness requires a self to give from. When you are depleted, resentful, and running on empty, what you offer others is not generosity — it is performance.

**5. Find your language.**
You can set a boundary gently: "I care about this, and I need some time to think about it." The words matter less than the intention behind them: *I am allowed to have needs too.*

## You Are Allowed to Take Up Space

The transition from "good girl" to grounded woman is not a rejection of your culture. It is a reclamation. You can honour your family, respect your community, and still hold space for your own needs. These are not contradictions. They are what a healthy, whole life looks like.

If anything in this article resonated with you, I want you to know that seeking support is not a sign of weakness — it is an act of courage.

### Editorial Notes for Dr. Swapna

The article flows from cultural context to clinical evidence to REBT framework to practical steps. Here are suggestions for where your personal and clinical experiences would strengthen the piece:

1. **Opening scenario** (paragraphs 1-3): Consider replacing the fictional scenario with a real (anonymized) client story that captures this dynamic.

2. **"The Cultural Blueprint" section:** If you have personal experiences growing up with "adjust karo" expectations, a brief personal reflection here would add tremendous weight.

3. **REBT section:** Consider adding a brief exchange from a session (anonymized) where you walked a client through the "must" vs "preference" distinction. A concrete dialogue — even 3-4 lines — would make REBT immediately tangible.

4. **Practical steps:** If any steps come from techniques you have personally refined with clients, noting that adds clinical authority.

5. **Closing:** Consider adding a sentence about your own relationship with these patterns — "As a South Asian woman myself, I know these patterns from the inside" creates powerful connection.
