### Foundational Articles

### Indian Diaspora Angles

4. **Why South Asians Don't Talk About Sex Addiction — And Why We Must**
   MAJOR content gap. Only 14% of Indian adults with problematic sexual behavior have ever sought help. Cultural taboo = underserved audience.

*Broad audience appeal. Positions your methodology (CBT, REBT, DBT, TA) as your unique lens.*

### Foundational Articles

6. **CBT, DBT, or REBT? A Plain-Language Guide to Evidence-Based Approaches for Anxiety**
   "CBT vs DBT" is a high-volume search query. Most articles don't include REBT — your multi-modality expertise is a differentiator.

7. **What Is REBT and Why Don't More People Know About It?**
   REBT is underrepresented in popular content despite strong evidence base. Meta-analysis shows medium significant effect sizes across multiple outcomes. Content gap opportunity.

### Indian Diaspora Angles

8. **Depression in the Indian Diaspora: When "Adjusting" Becomes Suffering**
   Indian culture values adjustment ("adjust karo") which masks depressive symptoms. Deeply resonant with diaspora.
